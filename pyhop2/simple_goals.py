    In most classical planners, one would declare data-types for the parameters
    of each action, and the data-type checks would be done by the planner.
    Pyhop 2 doesn't have a way to do that, so the 'is_a' function gives us a
    way to do it in the preconditions of each action, command, and method.
    
    'is_a' doesn't implement subtypes (e.g., if rigid.type[x] = y and
    rigid.type[x] = z, it doesn't infer that rigid.type[x] = z. It wouldn't be
    hard to implement this, but it isn't needed in the simple-travel domain.

# Pyhop 2 provides a built-in multigoal method called m_split_goals.
# Given a multigoal G, it separates G into aÂ collection of individual goals.
# It returns a list of goals [g1, ..., gn, G], where g1, ..., gn are the
# goals in G that aren't true in the current state. This causes Pyhop 2 to
# achieve g1, ..., gn sequentially, and then to call m_split_goals again,
# to re-achieve any goals that (due to deleted-condition interactions)
# became false while accomplishing g1, ..., gn.
# The main problem with m_split_goals is that it isn't smart about choosing
# the order in which to achieve g1, ..., gn. In general, some orders will
# work better than others, and a possible project would be to create a
# heuristic function to choose a good order.
