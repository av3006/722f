    The status of a block b1 is defined as follows:
    - If b1 and the blocks below it will never need to be moved, it is 'done'.
    - Otherwise, if b1 isn't clear, then its status is 'inaccessible'
    - Otherwise, we examine why b1 needs to be moved:
      - If b1 has no goal position, then there must be a block below b1 that needs
          to be moved, so b1's status is 'move-to-table' to get it out of the way.
      - If b1's goal position is the table, then its status is 'move-to-table'.
      - If b1's goal position is a clear block that's done, then its status
          is 'move-to-block'.
      - Otherwise, we can't move b1 to its goal position until some other
          blocks are moved, so its status is 'waiting'.

"""
In each pyhop2 planning method, the first argument is the current state (this is analogous to Python methods, in which the first argument is the class instance). The rest of the arguments must match the arguments of the task that the method is for. For example, ('pickup', b1) has a method holding_m(state,b1), as shown below.

### methods for "move_blocks"

def m_moveb(state,multigoal):
    """
    This method implements the following block-stacking algorithm: 
    - If there's a clear block b that can be moved to a position where it will
      never need to be moved again, then do so, and invoke the multigoal again.
    - Otherwise, if there's a clear block b that needs to be moved out of the
      way in order to make another block accessible, then move b to the table,
      and invoke the multigoal again.
    - Otherwise, no blocks need to be moved.
